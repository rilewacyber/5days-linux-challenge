A 5-day hands-on Linux challenge to build foundational command-line skills for cybersecurity.
# 🐧 5-Day Linux Challenge – By Mariam (aka Rilewa)

Welcome to my 5-day Linux challenge!  
As part of my journey into cybersecurity and cloud security, I committed to learning and documenting the Linux basics — one day at a time.

This repo includes hands-on exercises, command-line practice, tools explored, and reflections for each day.
