# 🛡️ Day 2 – Users and Permissions

In Linux, every file or directory is assigned to a user and a group, and has a set of permissions that control who can access or modify it. Understanding this is key to managing security and access control in a Linux system.

## 🔐 Permission Classes

There are three main permission classes:

- **User (u)** — The file or directory's owner  
- **Group (g)** — A group of users with shared access  
- **Others (o)** — All other users not in the group  
- **All (a)** — Applies changes to user, group, and others at once

## ✅ Permission Types

Each class can be assigned the following permissions:

- **Read (r)** — View file contents or list directory  
- **Write (w)** — Modify file contents or directory  
- **Execute (x)** — Run the file or enter a directory

Users and groups typically have full permissions (`rwx`), but it is not advisable to give the same to others for security reasons.

Let’s go to the `Desktop` directory, where we previously created the `Groceries` file (see Day 1).  
Run:

```bash
ls
